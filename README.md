<h1>Settings-Recall</h1>

<small>Name subject to change.</small>

Backup and easily restore your programs' settings to make reformatting less painful!

This is designed for Windows only. In other OSes, you probably don't need such a tool!

<h2>Development</h2>

We're developing this program in C# as a WPF project. We're using XAML to draw the frontend and a SQLite database for the backend.
